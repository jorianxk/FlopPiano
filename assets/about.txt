The FlopPiano is an attempt to build a unique and musically useful instrument from old and broken keyboards, reclaimed wood, e-waste, and parts designed for other devices. Almost all software and electronics were custom designed to make the system as powerful and user-friendly as a floppy drive piano can reasonably be. All similarities to sentient floppy disks present and past are purely coincidental, and all hidden easter eggs will be the reusable plastic type.
Great pains were taken to make the FlopPiano play nicely with other MIDI devices, though odd behavior may happen from time to time. When this happens please don't break the glass, just use the 'mute' and 'reset functions in the UI. We, here, in the FlopPiano community like to run a tight ship, so please put new and untested MIDI files in a subdirectory. This will prevent the user from accidentally selecting a potentially broken file when attempting to show off the system to an impressed audience.
Please be kind, rewind, and donâ€™t forget to tip your bartender. The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, and for the love of God, don't forget about Dre. He really hates that.
