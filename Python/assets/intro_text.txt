Best if used in CLI with 90 columns and 30 lines (The backup camera's CLI resolution)

This is a demonstration of a FIGlet UI tools that I built on top of asciimatics.
I don't think we can use the in built UI from asciimatics because it uses single
characters for text. Since, we're using a tiny screen, text that is only a single
character in height is very hard to read. Therefore, we must use a bigger "font". Thats
where FIGlet text come into play. It generates larger ASCII based renditions of text! So,
I built a simple/sloppy python module that mimics behavior of an event based UI with two
simple "Widgets". 

A Widget is really just a wrapper around Figlet text, but they offer a little more 
functionality and are UI fields. There are two types of Widgets; Labels and Buttons. 
-- A label is a simple non-user-editable text field that can not be given focus. A label 
is used to display information.
-- A button is a focus-able, click-able field that performs an programmable action (using 
callbacks).

All Widgets are housed in a Page (which is analogous to a Frame) The page handles the 
Widgets, input focusing and orchestrations.

                               Keyboard controls:
                               
            [ENTER] or [SPACE] -> Sequence break. Just skip to the next Scene

[UP]     -> Next Page                 [RIGHT]  -> Next Button
[DOWN]   -> Previous Page             [LEFT]   -> Previous Button
[INSERT] -> Click/ Press buttons      [ctrl+C] -> Exit
